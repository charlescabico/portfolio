          <p>I haven't got any experience yet, but as of now I've been learning technology that will help me to put my career to Web Development. I have been putting half of my days to learn things that I want to learn and the things I could use for my future job. I sometimes forget to eat just to modify some codes in my project that I've been working. I got to tell you man, it isn't easy for me to do this kind of things 'cause I used be lazy and addictive playing games and you know, going out with friends. It's just now, it just kicks me. I used to doubt myself. I was skeptical to anything. I will not promise anythings because "promise" means nothing to me. So, I'll just put an end to this and I'll work something out to feel myself great.</p>
