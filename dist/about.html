          <!-- <p>I haven't got any experience yet, but as of now I've been learning technology that will help me to put my career to Web Development. I have been putting half of my days to learn things that I want to learn and the things I could use for my future job. I sometimes forgot to eat just modifying some codes in the project that I've been working. I got to tell you man, it wasn't easy for me to do this kind of things 'cause laziness was a thing I wasn't overcome before, and it's like an obstacle for me for years, and  It's just now, it just kicks me. I used to doubt myself. I was skeptical to anything... Now, I will not promise anythings because "promise" means nothing to me. So, I'll just put an end to this and I'll work something out to feel myself great.</p> -->
          <p>

I also speak two languages, Tagalog and English, how cool is that?
